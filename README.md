# Financial Data Analysis Pipeline

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive, end-to-end financial data analysis pipeline developed as part of a structured Data Engineering course. The project emphasizes modern practices in containerization, workflow orchestration, data warehousing, analytics engineering, batch processing, and real-time data streaming tailored specifically for financial datasets including stock market and macroeconomic indicators.

## Key Objectives
- **Robust Pipelines:** Build efficient data pipelines for financial data analysis.
- **Containerization & IaC:** Use Docker and Terraform for scalable financial infrastructure.
- **Workflow Automation:** Orchestrate automated data workflows.
- **Data Warehousing:** Optimize data storage and retrieval in BigQuery.
- **Analytics Engineering:** Leverage structured data analytics processes using dbt.
- **Batch Processing:** Analyze extensive historical financial data with Apache Spark.
- **Streaming Data:** Handle real-time financial data feeds with Apache Kafka.
